Due to the restrictions of a maximum repository size, some of the data has been removed from these files. Due to this, generated plots using this data may vary from the results published.

Data Removed:

- In Experiments 7, 8, 9 I show data for a reduced number of market sessions
- Experiment 6 data has been removed as it was 11GB in size, and the results do not differ significantly from those in Experiment 4 (N~P~ = 50)

To generate plots, open a `Jupyter Notebook` and go to the `NegativeInfluencers/` folder in each experiment ZIP folder. The `.ipynb` file will contain the code for generating plots.
